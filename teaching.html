        <h2>My mission</h2>
        <p>I've had the chance to not only have teachers, but real mentors who pushed me further every day in the studio, taking the time to get to know me and understand where I wanted to go.This is the reason why I feel that being a teacher is so much more that simply teaching a technique or a dance combination. It’s a real commitment. It’s about transmitting, communicating, sharing, but also listening and understanding. This is my vision and my personal goal as a teacher. I always thought you can see a good teacher from his work inside the studio, but even more outside. I hope to have the chance to give back what I received as a student, which completely changed my life.</p>
