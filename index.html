        <h2 id="careerTitle">My Career</h2>
        <p id="careerP">My professional dance journey started at the age of 18, when I participated in the dance competition “Danza and State” and won a scholarship to study at the Academy Balletto di Toscana-Opus Ballet in Florence, Italy.<br>I studied there for 2 years, becoming a dance member of the Junior BDT and the Opus Ballet Company. I got the chance to work with choreographers as Mauro Bigonzetti, Fabrizio Monteverde and Daniel Tinazzi.<br>In 2003 I left Italy for France where I met Dominique Lesdema. With him I refined my professional dance education and joined his modern company “Kinetic”.<br>Since then, I've also had the privilege to work with many other inspiring choreographers in France and the Netherlands.

        <h2>My Teaching Mission</h2>
        <p>I've had the chance to not only have teachers, but real mentors who pushed me further every day in the studio, taking the time to get to know me and understand where I wanted to go.<br>This is the reason why I feel that being a teacher is so much more than simply teaching a technique or a dance combination. It’s a real commitment.<br>It’s about transmitting, communicating, sharing, but also listening and understanding. This is my vision and my personal goal as a teacher.
