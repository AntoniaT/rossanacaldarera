        <h2>My story</h2>
        <p>I â€˜ve always been an active kid. I constantly had the need to move; to run, to jump, to fall, to sing.. I tried many sports like swimming, basketball, running, but I always felt I was missing something.<br>When I was about 6 years old I tried my first dance class: Ballet. The result: I hated it! For me it was not "active" enough. But there was something I completely fell in love with : the music and the connection with it.<br>I did not come back for a full month, until I stumbled upon The Nutcracker while I was watching TV. I instinctively started dancing. I don't know how and which movements or style, but I just remember running to my parents saying :<br>'I want to dance!!'
